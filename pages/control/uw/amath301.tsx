        <p>
          This is a course review of AMATH 301 — Beginning Scientific Computing.
          I took this class in Summer 2020 with Alanna Gary and was my first
          class in the Applied Mathematics department here at UW. Overall, I
          found this to a pretty reasonable class that helped introduce me to
          the field of Applied Mathematics.
        </p>

        <h3> Overview, Covered Material, & Course Structure </h3>
        <p>
          AMATH 301 is meant to serve as introduction to scientific and
          mathematical computing using MATLAB. This meant its only prerequiste
          was MATH 125 (integral calculus). Since I took the honors calculus
          series here at UW (MATH 13x) which covers differential equations and
          linear algebra in addition to differential, integral, and
          multivariable calculus, I was already familiar with a lot of the
          mathematical material covered. For instance, some of the lectures
          provided an introduction to things like matrices,
          eigenvalues/eigenvectors, Taylor Series, and ordinary differential
          equations which were all things I had already learned in MATH 13x.
          Additionally, since the class assumes no prior programming knowledge,
          a lot of the beginning material was dedicated to explaining
          programming basics like variables and for loops. Despite already
          knowing a lot of the programming and conceptual mathematical topics, I
          took this class because it is a requirement to apply to the Applied
          Math major here at UW which I plan to double major in along side
          Computer Science.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here is a list of topics covered when I took the class:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Root and min/max finding algorithms (Newton-Raphson, Bisection,
              Golden Section Search)
            </li>

            <li>Big O Notation</li>

            <li>
              Solving linear systems of equations (Gaussian elimination, LU
              Decomposition, Jacobi Iteration, Gauss-Seidel Iteration)
            </li>

            <li>Optimization and Gradient Descent</li>

            <li>Curve fitting</li>

            <li>Numerical differentiation/integration</li>

            <li>Time-stepping methods for solving ODEs</li>

            <li>
              COVID-19 Modeling and Singular Value Decomposition (Optional
              material)
            </li>
          </ul>
          Since Summer 2020 was still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, all
          classes were conducted remotely. Each week, we were required to watch
          several prerecorded lectures, complete a programming assigment in
          MATLAB (45% of our grade), complete an activity (20% of our grade),
          and take an open book (but not open internet) quiz every Friday (35%
          of our grade). I found the workload to be very reasonable and not
          stressful at all especially when it was revealed we would be able to
          drop our lowest quiz and homework score.

        <h3> My Thoughts on the Class</h3>
        <p>
          Overall, I found AMATH 301 to be a pretty reasonable class. Though I
          did already have experience with things like ODEs, solving linear
          systems, and eigenvalues/eigenvectors from MATH 13x, I was still able
          to learn a lot during the class mainly because the class focused on
          the applications rather than the conceptual groundings of those
          topics. For example, I came into the course already knowing what an
          eigenvalue and eigenvector were but I ended up learning that they can
          be used to determine whether or not an iterative method for solving
          linear systems would converge or diverge. It was also very interesting
          to see how ODEs are solved since I never learned Euler's method or
          other time stepping algorithms in MATH 13x. For that reason, I am both
          glad and disappointed that I came in already knowing like half the
          material — I really only had to put in half the effort but at the same
          time it felt like I was only learning new things half the time.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm not too sure on the validity of this but apparently my quarter is
          the last quarter that the Applied Math department will be using MATLAB
          in AMATH 301 and instead will be teaching in Python in the future. I
          think this makes a lot of sense since Python is extremely friendly to
          beginners and becoming more and more used in scientific computing. I
          will say that I am glad though that I took it before the switch since
          I did not have very much experience with MATLAB before this and
          already had lots of experience with Python. I also think this is a
          great class for anyone in STEM or interested in applied math. If
          already know more advanced math and how to program, I think that a lot
          of the material could be self-studied (especially since most lectures
          are uploaded on{" "}

          ) but if you want to take higher level Applied Math classes like me,
          you're going to have to take this class regardless of prior knowledge.
