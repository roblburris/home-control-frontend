          This is my first post where I talk about the specifics behind the
          development process of a project I've completed. Since this was
          written after I finished my website, I am not as detailed as I would
          have liked to be when talking about my development process but for
          future posts I plan to keep a more detailed record of my development.
          For this post, I'll be talking about how I redid my website in React
          and TypeScript. Compared to a frontend built in HTML/CSS with vanilla
          JavaScript, I really enjoyed working with React and definitely plan to
          incoporate it in future projects.
          <h3> Motivation </h3>
          Me redesigning my website was something I had planned for the past few
          months but never had a chance to get to due to school, working on
          other projects, and a lack of time. It was not until the end of UW's
          2020 Summer Quarter when I realized that the break between Summer and
          Autumn quarter was the best time to redo my website in React. Before
          this, my experience with React was quite limited and before fully
          diving into internship application season, I wanted to make my website
          more pretty and add things like React and TypeScript to my resume.
          <h3> Development </h3>
          From the beginning I knew I was going to use Next.js for routing.
          Unfortunately when I started my project, I did not realize that the{" "}
          <code>npx create-next-app --example with-typescript</code> command
          existed and instead started working out of a standard create-react-app
          with TypeScript. This would not have been an issue since you can add
          Next.js to an existing project but for some reason my app stopped
          working and I had to copy my existing React components to a fresh
          create-next-app.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once I did this, everything began running smoothly. Next.js makes
          routing incredibly easy and with that out of the way, I was able to
          focus on developing the rest of my website. A big issue on my old
          website was the lack of a mobile friendly layout. When developing the
          frontend, I completely forgot to make my website responsive which was
          a big mistake. Luckily, I did not forget this and implemented a mobile
          friendly navbar. To do this, I made use of React hooks and followed
          this helpful{" "}
          <a
            style={{ color: "black" }}
            href="https://dev.to/joserfelix/create-a-mobile-friendly-navigation-with-react-4930"
          >
            guide
          </a>{" "}
          on using the hooks with a navbar designed on my own. Apart from mobile
          friendly/responsive design, I also changed color themes. I considered
          implementing a toggle between light/dark mode but ultimately I liked
          using the blue/white theme. I also switched to having my Resume page
          be linked to a file instead of an iframe under my website. I couldn't
          really find/figure out any good ways to embed a PDF in my website
          (that also looked good on mobile) so having the page link to a PDF was
          much easier and aesthetically pleasing.
          <h3> Future Plans </h3>I wanted to get my website updated before the
          start of September so unfortunately I was not able to add all the
          features I would have liked. However, I do plan to continue working on
          my website in the future. Here are some of the things I would like to
          add in the next few months:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="/blog/planned-projects" style={{ color: "black" }}>
                CI/CD Content Management System
              </a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Tagging system for blog posts</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Increase space between main content and footer</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Add animations to mobile navbar</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Use HTTPS instead of HTTP</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
    </Template>
  );
}

export default Blog;
